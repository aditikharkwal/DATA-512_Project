# Common Analysis for the Wildfire impact on Cladwell city in the state of Idaho

**Introduction**

In recent years, the western United States has experienced a notable uptick in the occurrence of extensive wildfires, resulting in the widespread dispersion of smoke across multiple states. This concerning trend has prompted discussions about its potential causes, including factors such as climate change, US forestry policies, and a heightened societal awareness of the issue. Regardless of the underlying drivers, the impacts of these wildland fires are profoundly felt. Extensive research now underscores the adverse effects of smoke on various aspects of society, including health, tourism, property values, and more.

This course project endeavors to delve into a detailed analysis of the ramifications of wildfires on a specific city within the United States. The overarching goal is to equip key stakeholders such as policymakers, city managers, city councils, and civic institutions with the necessary insights to make well-informed decisions regarding the formulation of plans aimed at mitigating future impacts stemming from wildfires.
