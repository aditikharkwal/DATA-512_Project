# DATA-515_Project

The course project consists of four parts: 

Part 1 - Common Analysis sets the stage for the subsequent assignments. In Part 1 you conduct a base analysis. All of the students in the class will conduct the same analysis, but with a slightly different data subset.

Part 2 - Extension Plan will require you to ask a human centered data science question that extends the work in Course Project Part 1 - Common Analysis. 

Part 3 - Presentation will require you to give a modified (shorter) PechaKucha presentation of your completed project.

Part 4 - Project Repository, creation of a fully documented repository and also requires the submission of a written project report.

# Summary of the project

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of wildfires in the US, focusing on the Caldwell, Idaho region. The primary aim was to assess the environmental, societal, and human impact of these wildfires, particularly in relation to the production of smoke. To quantify the influence of wildfire smoke on the city, I calculated a smoke impact estimate. One key research question involved establishing correlations between my smoke estimates and the actual Air Quality Index in the region. Notably, I observed fewer fires in close proximity to the city, but an alarming trend of extensive land burned by wildfires in recent years. My predictive modeling indicated a projected increase in smoke within the city in the coming years, highlighting the need for proactive measures by local authorities to safeguard residents.

Taking a human-centered approach, I investigated the potential link between wildfire smoke and economy in the city. Examining specific industries, such as agriculture and healthcare, in relation to average smoke estimates provided a nuanced understanding of potential correlations over the years. The findings indicate noteworthy connections between fluctuations in employment within these sectors and changes in the amount of smoke in the air. For instance, a decrease in farming jobs correlated with an increase in smoke, while an uptick in healthcare employment demonstrated a corresponding rise in smoke. These interdependencies are crucial for informed decision-making regarding the economic implications of wildfires on jobs and overall economic well-being. The results emphasize the need for strategic planning and policies that address both environmental and economic dimensions, ensuring a holistic approach to mitigating the impacts of wildfires on the community.
